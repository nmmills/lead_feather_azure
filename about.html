        <h3>Steve, Kristen, Nolan and Lincoln</h3>
            <p>In 2023, the Baker family, also a homeschooled family, joined our camp.</p>
            <p><q>Our family started participating in the Alafia River Rendezvous after touring the event with a homeschool group. Our boys started begging to be a part of this living history event, and I knew we needed to support that. They wait all year for this one week where we can slow down, learn lost skills, and deepen our knowledge of history. The families in our encampment have become dear friends that we look forward to spending time with year after year.</q> <em>- Kristen and Steve Baker</em>
